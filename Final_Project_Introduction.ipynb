That is, the location of a property determines its value. A one storey, one bedroom house in Hamptons, New York, will cost more than a three storey, six bedroom house in Boise, Idaho. The same can be considered true in the Restaurant Business. For world-renowned chefs like Gordon Ramsey or Jamie Oliver, the location of their restaurant can be a secondary factor as customers usually flock to their restaurants for experiencing fine dining. But for someone who is starting out in the industry and doesn't have a reputation to rely on, the success of their endeavor will heavily depend on the location of their restaurant. Open a restaurant in a location with less foot traffic, and you won't have any customers. Open a restaurant in a location that has similar types of restaurants, then you are fighting for the customer share and trying to leave a mark of your own.\n\nThe mathematical approach described in this report provides a two-fold solution for the above-mentioned problem:\n*  At a particular location, what would be the best type of restaurant to invest in\n*  For a particular cuisine, where would the best location be to open a restaurant \n\nThis report will be of interest to two types of audience:\n*  An Investor who wants to cash in on the appeal of a location\n*  A Chef who is trained in a specific culinary style",
